# Flutter OOP Example

In this tutorial, we talked about Object Oriented Programming in Flutter.

We talked about abstraction, encapsulation, singleton and MVVM. I tried to explain the pros and cons of OOP. And we made an example with a very common service, the network service. I showed how you can easily change one of your main packages thanks to OOP. I explained how to work package independent. I am waiting for your feedback and I hope you watch the video.
